Introduction
Network security professionals often require comprehensive tools to thoroughly scan and assess the security posture of a network. Nmap, a powerful network scanning tool, offers extensive capabilities through its Nmap Scripting Engine (NSE). In this blog post, we'll walk through creating an advanced deep network scan NSE script that combines service detection, version detection, OS detection, and vulnerability scanning.

Prerequisites
Ensure you have Nmap installed on your system. You can download it from Nmap's official website.

Creating the Advanced Deep Network Scan Script
We'll create a custom NSE script named advanced_deep_network_scan.nse to perform a deep and comprehensive scan.

Running the Script
To run the script, save it as advanced_deep_network_scan.nse and execute the following Nmap command:

sudo nmap -sV -O --script=default,vulners,http-enum,smb-enum-shares,ftp-anon,ssh-auth-methods,advanced_deep_network_scan.nse -p- <target>
Replace <target> with the IP address or hostname of the system you want to scan.

Explanation
Description and Metadata: The script description, author, license, and categories are defined to provide context for the script.
Libraries: The script imports essential libraries (nmap, shortport, stdnse).
action function: This function processes the scan results for a given host and port:
Service and Version Detection: The script checks if version information is available and collects service details.
Vulnerability Information: It processes script results from other vulnerability scripts and includes their output.
OS Detection: If OS details are available, they are collected.
Script Results: Any additional script results are processed and added to the output.
portrule function: This function determines when the script should be executed. Here, it is set to run for all ports (1-65535) and both TCP and UDP protocols.
Conclusion
This advanced deep network scan script leverages the power of Nmap and its NSE to provide comprehensive scan results, including service details, version information, OS detection, and vulnerability assessments. By combining the outputs of multiple scripts, it offers a detailed view of the target network's security posture.

Feel free to modify and extend this script to suit your specific needs. Happy scanning!
