### Introduction

Network security professionals often rely on robust tools to thoroughly assess the security of networks. Nmap, renowned for its extensive capabilities, particularly through the Nmap Scripting Engine (NSE), stands out as a powerful network scanning tool. In this guide, we'll walk through the process of creating an advanced NSE script for conducting deep network scans. This script will encompass service detection, version detection, OS detection, and vulnerability scanning.

### Prerequisites

Ensure Nmap is installed on your system. You can download it from [Nmap's official website](https://nmap.org/download.html).

### Creating the Advanced Deep Network Scan Script

Let's develop a custom NSE script named `advanced_deep_network_scan.nse` tailored for comprehensive network scanning.

### Running the Script

Save the script as `advanced_deep_network_scan.nse` and execute the following Nmap command:

```bash
sudo nmap -sV -O --script=default,vulners,http-enum,smb-enum-shares,ftp-anon,ssh-auth-methods,advanced_deep_network_scan.nse -p- <target>
```

Replace `<target>` with the IP address or hostname of the system you intend to scan.

### Explanation

**Description and Metadata**: Define script metadata including description, author, license, and categories to provide context.

**Libraries**: Import essential libraries (`nmap`, `shortport`, `stdnse`) for script functionality.

**action function**: This function processes scan results for each host and port:

- **Service and Version Detection**: Check for available version information and gather service details.
  
- **Vulnerability Information**: Process results from other vulnerability scripts (`vulners`, `http-enum`, etc.) and incorporate their findings.
  
- **OS Detection**: Collect OS details if detected during the scan.
  
- **Script Results**: Include any additional script outputs relevant to the scan.

**portrule function**: Define when the script should execute. In this case, it's set to run across all ports (1-65535) for both TCP and UDP protocols.

### Conclusion

This advanced deep network scan script harnesses Nmap's capabilities via its NSE to deliver comprehensive scan results. It provides insights into service details, version information, OS detection, and vulnerabilities, consolidating outputs from multiple scripts for a detailed network security assessment.

Feel free to customize and expand upon this script to meet your specific requirements. Happy scanning!

This version is tailored for a GitHub post, focusing on clarity and practical implementation steps for users interested in network security scanning with Nmap and its scripting capabilities.
